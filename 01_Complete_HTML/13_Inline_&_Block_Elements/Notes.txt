HTML Inline Elements
Inline Elements don't start on a new line. It only takes the width required to cover the content.

HTML elements are generally divided into two categories: Block-level and Inline elements.
What are Inline Elements?
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow within other elements.

Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements. For example, you could nest a <strong> (strong emphasis) element within a <span> (a generic inline container) element, like so:

<span>This is <strong>important</strong> text.</span>
Common Inline Elements
<span>: A generic inline container for text
<a>: Defines a hyperlink
<strong>: Defines important text
<em>: Defines emphasized text
<img>: Embeds an image
<input>: Defines an input control

What are Block-level Elements?
Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.

Characteristics of Block-level Elements:
Always start on a new line.
Take up the full width available.
Width and height can be controlled via CSS.
Can contain other block-level as well as inline elements.
